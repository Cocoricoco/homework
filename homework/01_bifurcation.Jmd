# Introduction

> Starting from the logistic model of growth with competition, you will (i)
> propose an analysis to show how we can find a vaalue of the growth rate *r*
> after which the population cannot persist (this will involve finding the
> maximum of a function, and then iterating this function enough times from this
> maximum), and (ii) plot the bifurcation diagram of the logistic model to show
> that there is indeed a maximal growth rate after which the system becomes
> unstable. Please note that you should not attempt to calculate this value by
> hand, but you may attempt to guess it based on the results of the second step.

## Required packages

```julia
using Plots
```

## Model description and justification

<!-- Use this model, it assumes that K = 1, making the system dimensionless -->

$$n(t+1) = n(t) + r\times n(t)\times \left(1-n(t)\right)$$

## Model analysis

## Simulations

## Conclusions
