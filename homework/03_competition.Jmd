# Introduction

> Using the logistic model of growth for two populations with both intra and
> inter-specific competition, find the expression of the zero-growth isoclines,
> then define when the equilibriums with 1 and 2 species are feasible. When this
> is done, simulate this system as an ordinary differential equations problem,
> under three or four combinations of parameters, to show that the system
> behaves as predicted. There are various ways to formulate the model, either
> using a global carrying capacity for the population, or using four different
> competition terms (for intra and inter-specific competition).
